# 5G-NR-Performance-Plots

## Abstract:
The goal is to to understand by visualization the various PHY layer performace of a 5G device.
When logs are collected on any 4G/5G device using device tools, a lot of manual effort is involved in post-processing of the data to understand  
device performance

## Script description:
The script can be used to quickly understand by visualization the performance and other useful PHY layer info from the device based on the logs collecetd.

## Tools:
- Python programming
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Sample output:
